SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Not Invisible Act of 2019''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the National Institute of Justice reports more than 80 
        percent of American Indian and Alaska Native men and women have 
        experienced violence in their lifetimes and more than 34 
        percent have experienced violence in the last year;
            (2) the National Institute of Justice also estimates that 
        56 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women 
        experience sexual violence in their lifetimes;
            (3) murder is the third leading cause of death among 
        American Indian and Alaska Native women;
            (4) populations that experience chronic unemployment, 
        homelessness, substance abuse, severe poverty, and high rates 
        of sexual violence and other crimes are at a higher risk of 
        trafficking;
            (5) American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls 
        disproportionately experience the above risk factors;
            (6) historical trauma has increased the vulnerability of 
        American Indians and Alaska Natives to trafficking and other 
        forms of violent crime;
            (7) the Department of Justice has identified combating 
        human trafficking as a priority; and
            (8) reliable data on the prevalence of missing Native 
        people, murdered Native people, and human trafficking within 
        Indian lands and of American Indians and Alaska Natives is not 
        available.
