                        compile maps that depict the availability 
                        described in clause (i) (referred to in this 
                        section as ``coverage maps''), which the

    (b) Content of Rules.--
            (1) Establishment of a serviceable location fabric 
        regarding fixed broadband.--The rules issued by the Commission 
        under subsection (a)(1) shall--
                    (A) require the Commission to engage with an entity 
                with expertise with respect to geographic information 
                systems (referred to in this subsection as ``GIS'') to 
                create a common dataset of all locations in the United 
                States where fixed broadband internet access service 
                can be installed, as determined by the Commission;
                    (B) establish the Broadband Serviceable Location 
                Fabric, which shall--
                            (i) subject to subparagraph (C), contain 
                        geocoded information for each location 
                        identified under clause (i);
                            (ii) serve as the foundation upon which all 
                        data relating to the availability of fixed 
                        broadband internet access service collected 
                        under paragraph (2)(A) shall be overlaid;

                        the Commission to ensure that GIS location data 
                        is continuously improved and current; and
                    (C) prioritize implementing the Fabric for rural 
                areas of the United States before implementing the 
                Fabric for urban and suburban areas of the United 
                States.
            (2) Collection of information.--The rules issued by the

                wireless, or satellite broadband internet access 
                service, data that--
                            (i) allows for an understanding of where a 
                        standard broadband installation can occur;
                            (ii) includes information regarding the 
                        download and upload speeds with respect to 
                        broadband internet access service that the 
                        provider makes available;
                            (iii) can be georeferenced to the GIS data 
                        in the Fabric regarding the service area of the 
                        provider; and

                                challenging the accuracy of a coverage 
                                map; and
                                    (IV) the costs to consumers and 
                                providers resulting from a

                                more than 1 year because of a reliance 
                                on outdated or otherwise inaccurate 
                                information;
                            (ii) include a process for verifying the 
                        data submitted through the challenge process in 
                        order to ensure the reliability of that data;

                        process.
                    (C) Use of challenges.--The Commission shall use 
                data submitted through the challenge process 
                established under subparagraph (A) to evaluate the 
                accuracy of the coverage maps and update the maps as 
                the Commission adjudicates challenges brought through 
                that process.
            (5) Reform of form 477 process.--Not later than 180 days 
        after the date on which the rules issued under subsection (a)
