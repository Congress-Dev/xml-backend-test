        prevention, reuse and recycling, and innovation;
            (2) both domestic and international efforts are required to 
        make progress in combating marine debris;
            (3) efforts by States, communities, and corporations to 
        minimize the use of single-use plastic products have been 
        successful in raising awareness of the marine debris issue; and
            (4) while we make progress toward a more sustainable 
        future, we must recognize that there is significant amount of 
        plastic waste that has already been created that must be 
        prevented from entering the oceans through recycling, reuse, 
        repurposing, and other innovative means.

    In implementing the policy described in section 201, the President 
shall direct the United States representatives to appropriate 
international bodies and conferences (such as the United Nations 
Environment Programme, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the 
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, the Group of 7, the Group of 20, and

United States, consistent with the broad foreign policy goals of the 
United States, to advocate that each such body--
            (1) commit to significantly increasing efforts to promote 
        investment in well-designed waste management and plastic waste 
        elimination and mitigation projects and services that increase 
        access to safe waste management and mitigation services, in 
        partnership with the private sector and consistent with the 
        constraints of other countries;
            (2) address the waste management needs of individuals and 
        communities where access to municipal waste management services 
        is historically impractical or cost-prohibitive;
            (3) enhance coordination with the private sector--
                    (A) to increase access to solid waste management 
                services;
                    (B) to utilize safe and affordable reusable

                the circular economy;
            (4) provide technical assistance to foreign regulatory 
        authorities and governments to remove unnecessary barriers to 
        investment in otherwise commercially-viable projects related 
        to--
                    (A) waste management including recycling;
                    (B) the use of safe and affordable reusable 
                alternatives to disposable plastic products, to the 
                extent practicable; or

                foreign countries, particularly countries with little 
                to no solid waste management systems, facilities, or 
                policies in place;
                    (C) encouraging the development of standards and 
                practices, and increasing recycled content percentage

                        safety, and maritime activities;
                            (ii) changes in the amount and regional 
                        concentrations of plastic waste in the ocean, 
                        based on scientific modeling and forecasting;
                            (iii) the role rivers, streams, and other 
                        inland waterways play in serving as conduits

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the EPA Administrator shall, in consultation with 
stakeholders, develop a strategy to improve waste management and 
recycling infrastructure, particularly for waste management and 
recycling infrastructure systems not meeting national standards under 
subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6941 et seq.) and 
other waste standards, for the purpose of reducing potential leakage of 
plastic waste and other solid waste into waterways and oceans.

                    (C) increasing capacity for more types of plastic 
                (including plastic films) and other materials to be 
                collected, processed, and recycled or repurposed into 
                usable materials or products;
            (3) the development of new strategies and programs that 
        prioritize engagement and cooperation with States and the 
        private sector to expedite efforts and assistance in States to 
        partner with, encourage, advise, and facilitate the development 
        and execution, where practicable, of projects, programs, and 
        initiatives--
                    (A) to improve the capacity, security, and 
                standards of operations of waste management systems;
                    (B) to monitor and track how well waste management 
                systems are functioning, based on uniform and

                to those challenges; and
                    (D) to end intentional and unintentional incentives 
                for municipalities, industries, and individuals to 
                improperly dispose of municipal solid waste; and
            (4) strengthening markets for products with high levels of 
        recycled plastic content.
    (d) Complementary Activities.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
strategy developed under subsection (a) should include guidance on 
activities that are complementary to the activities described in 
subsection (c), such as--
            (1) reducing waste at the source of the waste, including 
        anti-litter initiatives;
            (2) developing effective trash provisions for--
                    (A) national pollutant discharge elimination system 
                permits issued to municipal separate storm sewer 
                systems under section 402 of the Federal Water 
                Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1342); and
                    (B) stormwater management plans;
            (3) capturing trash at stormwater inlets, stormwater 
        outfalls, or in bodies of water;
