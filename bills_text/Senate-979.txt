 To amend the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 to 
 incorporate the recommendations made by the Government Accountability

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Advance Contracts

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the Post-Katrina Emergency Management and Reform Act of 
        2006 (Public Law 109-925; 120 Stat. 1394) required the Federal 
        Emergency Management Agency to establish advance contracts, 
        which are established prior to disasters and are typically 
        needed to quickly provide life-sustaining goods and services in 
        the immediate aftermath of a disaster;
            (2) the catastrophic hurricanes and wildfires in the United 
        States in 2017 highlighted the importance of these advance 
        contracts in disaster response;
            (3) in a report issued by the Government Accountability 
        Office entitled ``2017 Disaster Contracting: Action Needed to 
        Better Ensure More Effective Use and Management of Advance 
        Contracts'', the Government Accountability Office identified a 
        number of challenges with advance contracts and recommended 
        actions to improve management by the Federal Emergency 
        Management Agency of these contracts for future disasters; and
            (4) section 691 of the Post-Katrina Emergency Management 
        Reform Act of 2006 (6 U.S.C. 791) should be amended to 
        incorporate the recommendations made by the report described in 
        paragraph (3) to ensure more effective use and management of 
        advance contracts.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY ADVANCE CONTRACTS.
