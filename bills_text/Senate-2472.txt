                                 A BILL


 
  To redesignate the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum Brook 
Station, Ohio, as the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at the Neil A. 
                        Armstrong Test Facility.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Neil A. Armstrong, through his own definition, was 
        first and foremost as a test pilot.
            (2) A native of Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong began his 
        inspiring career in space exploration in Cleveland, Ohio, at 
        what is now the NASA John H. Glenn Research Center.
            (3) Becoming the first human to land a spacecraft, and then 
        set foot upon, the moon, represents the greatest dream of any 
        test pilot.
            (4) Therefore, it is fitting that the premier aeronautics 
        and space test station in Ohio should be renamed in his honor.

SEC. 3. REDESIGNATION OF NASA JOHN H. GLENN RESEARCH CENTER AT PLUM 
              BROOK STATION, OHIO, AS NASA JOHN H. GLENN RESEARCH 
              CENTER AT THE NEIL A. ARMSTRONG TEST FACILITY.

    (a) Redesignation.--The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Plum 
Brook Station, Ohio, is hereby redesignated as the NASA John H. Glenn 
Research Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility.
    (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, 
paper, or other record of the United States to the station referred to 
in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a reference to the ``NASA John 
H. Glenn Center at the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility''.
    (c) Savings.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter 
the relationship between the Plum Brook Station and the NASA John H. 
Glenn Research Center.
