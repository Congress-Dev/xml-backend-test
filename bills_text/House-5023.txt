                                 A BILL


 
 To name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient 
    clinic in Youngstown, Ohio, as the ``Carl Nunziato VA Clinic''.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Carl Nunziato graduated from Youngstown State 
        University ROTC as the Distinguished Military Graduate in 1961 
        and commissioned into the U.S. Army.
            (2) While serving, Major (ret.) Nunziato was stationed in 
        Thailand during the Laotian Crisis. Major Nunziato later served 
        two voluntary tours of combat duty in Vietnam.
            (3) On his second tour, then-Captain Nunziato was severely 
        injured, losing both legs from a mortar attack while protecting 
        a small Vietnamese village in Soui Da.
            (4) Major Nunziato spent two years at Walter Reed Military 
        Hospital recovering from his wounds. He then returned home to 
        Northeastern Ohio where he enrolled in Case Western University 
        Law School earning a degree in 1971. Following retirement from 
        active duty, Major Nunziato continuously championed the rights 
        of veterans and the disabled, while establishing a 
        distinguished career in banking and finance.
            (5) Due to Major Nunziato's tireless efforts, a Department 
        of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic was established in 
        Youngstown. Additionally, his exhaustive work throughout 
        Mahoning County has brought curb cuts, wheel chair ramps and 
        other accessibility measures to county public buildings, 
        universities and courthouses, affording more independence to 
        local disabled population. These efforts were borne from 
        witnessing fellow disabled veterans denied justice and 
        equality, after having fought and sacrificed for those same 
        principles.

SEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED 
              OUTPATIENT CLINIC, YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO.

clinic in Youngstown, Ohio, shall, after the date of the enactment of
