_______________________________________________________________________

                                 AN ACT


 
To require the disclosure of ownership of high-security space leased to 
         accommodate a Federal agency, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.

    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Secure Federal 
Leases from Espionage And Suspicious Entanglements Act'' or the 
``Secure Federal LEASEs Act''.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Government Accountability Office has reported that 
        the Federal Government often leases high-security space from 
        private sector landlords;
            (2) the General Services Administration collects highest-
        level and immediate ownership information through the System 
        for Award Management, but it is not currently required to 
        collect beneficial ownership information and lacks an adequate 
        system for doing so;
            (3) the General Services Administration and Federal 
        agencies with leasing authority may not know if foreign owners 
        have a stake in the buildings leased by the agencies, either 
        through foreign-incorporated legal entities or through 
        ownership in United States-incorporated legal entities, even 
        when the leased space is used for classified operations or to 
        store sensitive data; and
            (4) according to a report of the Government Accountability 
        Office, dated January 2017, that examined the risks of foreign 
        ownership of Government-leased real estate, ``leasing space in 
        foreign-owned buildings could present security risks such as 
        espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access''.
