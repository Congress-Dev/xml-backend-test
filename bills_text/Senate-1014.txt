                                 A BILL


 
    To establish the Route 66 Centennial Commission, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Route 66 Centennial Commission 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) Route 66 was the first all-paved highway in the United 
        States under the United States Highway System connecting the 
        Midwest to California, and has played a major role in the 
        history of the United States;
            (2) Route 66 was the symbol of opportunity for hundreds of 
        thousands of people seeking escape from the Dust Bowl in the 
        1930s, serving as a ``road to opportunity'' in the West, and 
        providing employment during the Great Depression, as thousands 
        were put to work on road crews to pave the road;
            (3) Route 66 was invaluable in transporting troops, 
        equipment, and supplies across the country to the West, where 
        the Federal Government established multiple industries and 
        military bases during World War II, and on the conclusion of 
        the war in 1945, Route 66 was a key route taken by thousands of 
        troops as they returned home;
            (4) Route 66 symbolized the positive outlook of the United 
        States during the postwar economic recovery in the 1950s and 
        1960s, serving as an icon of free-spirited independence and 
        linking people across the United States;
            (5) during the 1950s and 1960s, the tourist industry along 
        Route 66 grew tremendously, giving rise to countless tourist 
        courts, motels, service stations, garages, and diners;
            (6) since June 27, 1985, when Route 66 was decommissioned 
        as a Federal highway, the popularity and mythical stature of 
        Route 66 has grown domestically and internationally, as the 
        road has experienced a rebirth of interest and support; and
            (7) the year 2026 will be the centennial anniversary of 
        Route 66, and a commission should be established to study and 
        recommend in a report to Congress activities that are fitting 
        and proper to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that 
        appropriately honors the Mother Road of the United States.

Centennial Commission'' (referred to in this Act as the

        local governmental agencies and civic groups in carrying out 
        activities to honor Route 66 on the occasion of its centennial 
        anniversary;
            (3) recommend activities that may be carried out by the
