        the United States Geological Survey.
            (2) Great lakes basin.--The term ``Great Lakes Basin'' 
        means the air, land, water, and living organisms in the United 
        States within the drainage basin of the Saint Lawrence River at 
        and upstream from the point at which such river and the Great 
        Lakes become the international boundary between Canada and the 
        United States.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Great Lakes support a diverse ecosystem, on which 
        the vibrant and economically valuable Great Lakes fisheries 
        depend.
            (2) To continue successful fisheries management and 
        coordination, as has occurred since signing of the Convention 
        on Great Lakes Fisheries between the United States and Canada 
        on September 10, 1954, management of the ecosystem and its 
        fisheries require sound, reliable science, and the use of 
        modern scientific technologies.
            (3) Fisheries research is necessary to support 
        multijurisdictional fishery management decisions and actions 
        regarding recreational and sport fishing, commercial fisheries, 
        tribal harvest, allocation decisions, and fish stocking 
        activities.
            (4) President Richard Nixon submitted, and Congress 
        approved, Reorganization Plan No. 4 (84 Stat. 2090), conferring 
        science activities and management of marine fisheries to the 
        National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
            (5) Reorganization Plan No. 4 expressly excluded fishery 
        research activities within the Great Lakes from the transfer, 
        retaining management and scientific research duties within the 
        already-established jurisdictions under the 1954 Convention on 
        Great Lakes Fisheries, including those of the Great Lakes 
        Fishery Commission and the Department of the Interior.
    (c) Monitoring, Assessment, Science, and Research.--
            (1) In general.--The Director may conduct monitoring, 
        assessment, science, and research, in support of the binational 
        fisheries within the Great Lakes Basin.
            (2) Specific authorities.--The Director shall, under 
        paragraph (1)--
                    (A) execute a comprehensive, multi-lake, freshwater 
                fisheries science program;
                    (B) coordinate with and work cooperatively with 
                regional, State, tribal, and local governments; and
                    (C) consult with other interested entities groups, 
                including academia and relevant Canadian agencies.
            (3) Included research.--To properly serve the needs of 
        fisheries managers, monitoring, assessment, science, and 
        research under this section may include--
                    (A) deepwater ecosystem sciences;
                    (B) biological and food-web components;
                    (C) fish movement and behavior investigations;
                    (D) fish population structures;
                    (E) fish habitat investigations;
                    (F) invasive species science;
                    (G) use of existing, new, and experimental 
                biological assessment tools, equipment, vessels, other 
                scientific instrumentation and laboratory capabilities 
                necessary to support fishery management decisions; and
                    (H) studies to assess impacts on Great Lakes 
                Fishery resources.
            (4) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section is intended or 
        shall be construed to impede, supersede, or alter the authority 
        of the Great Lakes Fishery Commission, States, and Indian 
        tribes under the Convention on Great Lakes Fisheries between 
        the United States of America and Canada on September 10, 1954, 
        and the Great Lakes Fishery Act of 1956 (16 U.S.C. 931 et 
        seq.).
    (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--For each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2025, there is authorized to be appropriated $15,000,000 to

        portion of the non-Federal share of the cost of an activity 
        required to be paid by a State or an Indian Tribe under
