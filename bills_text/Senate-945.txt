                subparagraph (B) or (D) with respect to a covered 
                issuer, the Commission determines that the covered 
                issuer has a non-inspection year, the Commission shall 
                prohibit the securities of the covered issuer from 
                being traded on a national securities exchange.
                    ``(D) Removal of subsequent prohibition.--If, after 
                the end of the 5-year period beginning on the date on 
                which the Commission imposes a prohibition on a covered 
                issuer under subparagraph (C), the covered issuer 
                certifies to the Commission that the covered issuer 
                will retain a registered public accounting firm that 
                the Board is able to inspect under this section, the 
                Commission shall end that prohibition.
            ``(4) Rules.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
        enactment of this subsection, the Commission shall issue rules 
        that establish the manner and form in which a covered issuer 
        shall make a disclosure and a submission required under clauses 
        (i) and (ii) of paragraph (2)(B), respectively.''.
