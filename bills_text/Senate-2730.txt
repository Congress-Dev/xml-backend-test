                                 A BILL


 
  To establish and ensure an inclusive and transparent Drone Advisory 
                               Committee.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Drone Advisory Committee for the 
21st Century Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2016, a Drone Advisory Committee (in this section 
        referred to as the ``DAC'') was established at the Federal 
        Aviation Administration (in this Act referred to as the 
        ``FAA'') as a broad-based, long-term Federal advisory committee 
        to provide the FAA with advice on key unmanned aircraft systems 
        (in this Act referred to as ``UAS'') integration issues by 
        helping to identify challenges and prioritize improvements.
            (2) Pursuant to FAA Order 1110.157, dated June 15, 2018, 
        the DAC is charged with helping create broad support for an 
        overall UAS integration strategy and vision.
            (3) As of the date of introduction of this legislation, no 
        direct representatives from rural America or the agriculture, 
        forestry, or rangeland sectors were members of the DAC.
            (4) According to the FAA's 2019 market forecast, the market 
        for UAS is growing faster than anticipated.
            (5) The agricultural drone market has an estimated value in 
        the realm of $250,000,000 and is predicted to grow 
        substantially.
            (6) Recent studies have suggested as many as three out of 
        every four farmers in the United States ``are currently using 
        or considering adopting [UAS] technology to assess, monitor and 
        manage their farm''.
            (7) Rural counties are the majority of counties in the 
        United States.
            (8) Pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 
        Congress is to determine whether or not the Federal advisory 
        committees are ``fairly balanced in terms of the points of view 
        represented''.
