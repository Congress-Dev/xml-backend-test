              AFFAIRS.

    (a) Definition of Registered Apprenticeship Program.--In this Act, 
the term ``registered apprenticeship program'' means an apprenticeship 
program registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (50 Stat. 664; 
commonly referred to as the ``National Apprenticeship Act'').
    (b) Additional Registered Apprenticeship Program Requirements.--The 
Secretary of Labor shall amend the rules and procedures regarding 
registered apprenticeship programs to include the following 
requirements:
            (1) Each sponsor of a program applying to be a registered 
        apprenticeship program shall provide a written assurance to the 
        Secretary that, upon the program's approval as a registered 
        apprenticeship program, the sponsor will--
                    (A) complete, for each program location, all 
                enrollment requirements to obtain approval under 
                chapters 30 through 36 of title 38, United States Code, 
                to allow individuals eligible for educational 
                assistance available under such chapters to use such 
                assistance for the registered apprenticeship program, 
                including the requirement of designating a Certifying 
                Official; and
                    (B) agree to record and maintain the records 
                concerning the registered apprenticeship program 
                required in order for individuals eligible for 
                educational assistance under title 38, United States 
                Code, to use such assistance for enrollment in the 
                registered apprenticeship program.
            (2)(A) To the extent practicable, a registered 
        apprenticeship program shall grant advanced standing or credit, 
        and provide increased wages commensurate to such standing or 
        credit, for any individual eligible for educational assistance 
        under title 38, United States Code, who--
                            (i) is enrolled in the registered 
                        apprenticeship program; and
                            (ii)(I) has a demonstrated competency 
                        applicable to the apprenticeship occupation; or
                            (II) has acquired experience, training or 
                        skills through military service that is 
                        applicable to the apprenticeship occupation.
            (B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), in the case of a 
        registered apprenticeship program that has preferential 
        language for veterans already in the program's apprenticeship 
        policies and standards as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
        the registered apprenticeship program may continue awarding 
        advanced standing or credit for veterans in accordance with 
        such existing apprenticeship program policies and standards.
            (3) When the Secretary of Labor initially approves a 
        registered apprenticeship program, the Secretary shall provide 
        a copy of the certificate of registration to--
                    (A) the State approving agency designated under 
                chapter 36 of title 38, United States Code, for the 
                State where the headquarters of the registered 
                apprenticeship program's sponsor are located; and
                    (B) the State approving agency, as determined under 
                the rules and procedures implementing the Act of August 
                16, 1937 (50 Stat. 664; commonly referred to as the 
                ``National Apprenticeship Act''), where the registered 
                apprenticeship program is located.
