Commemorative Coin Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
            (1) In 2000, Congress passed and President William J. 
        Clinton signed into law the National Law Enforcement Museum Act 
        (Public Law 106-492), which authorized the National Law 
        Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, Inc., to build the National 
        Law Enforcement Museum on Federal land in the District of 
        Columbia to honor and commemorate the service and sacrifice of 
        law enforcement officers in the United States.
            (2) In April 2016, construction began on the National Law 
        Enforcement Museum in the District of Columbia across the 
        street from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in 
        Judiciary Square.
            (3) The National Law Enforcement Museum formally opened in 
        October of 2018.
            (4) The National Law Enforcement Museum's mission is--

                service and sacrifice of America's law enforcement 
                officers;
                    (B) to serve as an important bridge between law 
                enforcement's past and present, between the heroes of 
                yesteryear and those who have followed in their 
                footsteps, and between America's peace officers and the 
                public they serve;
                    (C) increase public understanding and support for 
                law enforcement and to promote law enforcement safety; 
                and
                    (D) strengthen the relationship between law 
                enforcement and the communities they serve with 
                thought-provoking programs at the Museum and around the 
                country that promote dialogue on topics of current 
                interest.
