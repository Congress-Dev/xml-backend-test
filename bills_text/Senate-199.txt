SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe 
Reservation Restoration Act''.

SEC. 2. LEECH LAKE BAND OF OJIBWE RESERVATION RESTORATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) the Federal land described in subsection (b)(1) was 
        taken from members of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe during a 
        period--
                    (A) beginning in 1948;
                    (B) during which the Bureau of Indian Affairs 
                incorrectly interpreted an order of the Secretary of 
                the Interior to mean that the Department of the 
                Interior had the authority to sell tribal allotments 
                without the consent of a majority of the rightful 
                landowners; and
                    (C) ending in 1959, when the Secretary of the 
                Interior was--
                            (i) advised that sales described in 
                        subparagraph (B) were illegal; and
                            (ii) ordered to cease conducting those 
                        sales;
            (2) as a result of the Federal land described in subsection 
        (b)(1) being taken from members of the Leech Lake Band of 
        Ojibwe, the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe hold the smallest 
        percentage of its original reservation lands of any Ojibwe 
        bands in Minnesota;
            (3)(A) the applicable statute of limitations prohibits 
        individuals from pursuing through litigation the return of the 
        land taken as described in paragraph (1); but
            (B) a Federal judge ruled that the land could be restored 
        to the affected individuals through the legislative process;
            (4) a comprehensive review of the Federal land demonstrated 
        that--
                    (A) a portion of the Federal land is encumbered 
                by--
                            (i) utility easements;
                            (ii) rights-of-way for roads; and
                            (iii) flowage and reservoir rights; and
                    (B) there are no known cabins, campgrounds, lodges, 
                or resorts located on any portion of the Federal land; 
                and
            (5) on reacquisition by the Tribe of the Federal land, the 
        Tribe--
                    (A) has pledged to respect the easements, rights-
                of-way, and other rights described in paragraph (4)(A); 
                and
                    (B)(i) does not intend immediately to modify the 
                use of the Federal land; but
                    (ii) will keep the Federal land in tax-exempt fee 
                status as part of the Chippewa National Forest until 
                the Tribe develops a plan that allows for a gradual 
                subdivision of some tracts for economic and residential 
                development by the Tribe.
