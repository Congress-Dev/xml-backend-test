SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Opioid Detection Resilience Act 
of 2019''.

SEC. 2. STRATEGY TO ENSURE DETECTION OF ALL OPIOID PURITY LEVELS AT 
              PORTS OF ENTRY.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
section, the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) 
shall--
            (1) implement a strategy to ensure deployed chemical 
        screening devices are able to identify in an operational 
        environment narcotics at purity levels less than or equal to 10 
        percent, or provide ports of entry with an alternate method for 
        identifying narcotics at lower purity levels; and
            (2) require testing of any new chemical screening devices 
        to understand the abilities and limitations of such devices 
        relating to identifying narcotics at various purity levels 
        before CBP commits to the acquisition of such devices.

SEC. 3. PLAN TO ENSURE OPIOID DETECTION EQUIPMENT RESILIENCY.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
section, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall implement a plan for 
the long-term development of a centralized spectral database for 
chemical screening devices. Such plan shall address the following:
            (1) How newly identified spectra will be collected, stored, 
        and distributed to such devices in their operational 
        environment, including at ports of entry.
            (2) Identification of parties responsible for updates and 
        maintenance of such database.
