    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in 
        the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-
        383), namely that--
                    (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in 
                the continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of 
                Hong Kong'';
                    (B) ``[s]upport for democratization is a 
                fundamental principle of United States foreign 
                policy'';
                    (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong 
                are of great importance to the United States and are 
                directly relevant to United States interests in Hong 
                Kong [and] serve as a basis for Hong Kong's continued 
                economic prosperity''; and
                    (D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous 
                from the People's Republic of China to justify a 
                different treatment under a particular law of the 
                United States, or any provision thereof, from that 
                accorded the People's Republic of China;
            (2) to support the democratic aspirations of the people of 
        Hong Kong, as guaranteed to them by the Joint Declaration of 
        the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
        Northern Ireland and the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China on the Question of Hong Kong, done at Beijing December 
        19, 1984 (referred to in this Act as the ``Joint 
        Declaration''), the International Covenant on Civil and 
        Political Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966, the 
        Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at Paris December 
        10, 1948, and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
        Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China 
        (referred to in this Act as the ``Basic Law'');
            (3) to urge the Government of the People's Republic of 
        China to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong, including 
        allowing the people of Hong Kong to rule Hong Kong with a high 
        degree of autonomy and without undue interference, and ensuring 
        that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right to elect the Chief 
        Executive and all members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council 
        by universal suffrage;
            (4) to support the establishment of a genuine democratic 
        option to freely and fairly nominate and elect the Chief 
        Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment by 2020 of open 
        and direct democratic elections for all members of the Hong 
        Kong Legislative Council;
            (5) to support the robust exercise by residents of Hong 
        Kong of the rights to free speech and the press as guaranteed 
        to them by the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration;
            (6) to ensure that all residents of Hong Kong are afforded 
        freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention, or 
        imprisonment as guaranteed to them by the Basic Law and the 
        Joint Declaration;
            (7) to draw international attention to any violations by 
        the Government of the People's Republic of China of the 
        fundamental rights of residents of Hong Kong and any 
        encroachment upon the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong by the 
        Basic Law and the Joint Declaration;
            (8) to protect United States citizens and long-term 
        permanent residents living in Hong Kong and those visiting and 
        transiting through Hong Kong; and
            (9) to maintain the economic and cultural ties that provide 
        significant benefits to the United States and Hong Kong.

        certify to Congress, in conjunction with the report required 
        under section 301, whether Hong Kong is sufficiently autonomous 
        to justify special treatment by the United States for bilateral 
        agreements and programs, in accordance with this Act, including 
        the degree to which Hong Kong's autonomy has been eroded due to 
        actions taken by the Government of China that are inconsistent 
        with its commitments in the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration 
        and the impact of such erosion on specific areas of cooperation 
        with the United States, including on political rights, civil 
        liberties, rule of law, freedom of information, religious 
        freedom, and democratic governance in Hong Kong.
            ``(2) Factor for consideration.--In making a certification 
        under paragraph (1), the Secretary of State should consider the 
        terms, obligations, and expectations expressed in the Joint 
        Declaration with respect to Hong Kong.
    ``(b) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary of State may waive the 
application of subsection (a) if the Secretary--
            ``(1) determines that such a waiver is in the national 
        security interests of the United States; and
            ``(2) on or before the date on which the waiver takes 
        effect, notifies the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
        Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
        Representatives of the intent to waive such subsection.''.

Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5721 et seq.), as amended by subsection 
(a), is further amended by adding at the end the following:

              WORK IN THE UNITED STATES.

    ``(a) Statement of Policy.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
law, applications for visas to enter, study, or work in the United 
States, which are submitted by otherwise qualified applicants who 
resided in Hong Kong in 2014, shall not be denied on the basis of the 
applicant's arrest, detention, or other adverse government action taken 
as a result of the applicant's participation in nonviolent protest 
activities related to the electoral process, internationally recognized 
human rights, protecting an independent judiciary, or the rule of law.
    ``(b) Implementation.--The Secretary of State shall take such steps 
as may be necessary to ensure that consular officers are aware of the 
policy described in subsection (a) and receive appropriate training and 
support to ensure that the policy is carried out so that affected 
individuals do not face discrimination or unnecessary delay in the 
processing of their visa applications, including--
            ``(1) providing specialized training for consular officers 
        posted to Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangzhou, or Macau;
            ``(2) instructing the United States Consulate in Hong Kong 
        to maintain an active list of individuals whom are known to 
        have been detained, arrested, or otherwise targeted by the 
        Government of Hong Kong or of China, or intermediaries of such 
        governments, as a result of their participation in the 2014 
        protests, to facilitate the cross-checking of visa applications 
        for Hong Kong residents;
            ``(3) amending the physical and online versions of the visa 
        application, as necessary, to notify relevant applicants of 
        such policy; and
            ``(4) instructing personnel at the United States Consulate 
        in Hong Kong to engage with relevant individuals in the Hong 
        Kong community to proactively inform them that they will not 
        face discrimination when applying for a visa to the United 
        States due to any adverse action taken against them by the 
        authorities as a result of their participation in the 2014 
        protests or other peaceful pro-democracy or human rights 
        demonstrations.
    ``(c) Cooperation With Like-Minded Countries.--The Secretary of 
State, or his or her designee, shall contact appropriate 
representatives of other democratic countries, particularly those who 
receive a large number of applicants for student and employment visas 
from Hong Kong--
            ``(1) to inform them of the United States policy regarding 
        arrests for participation in nonviolent protests in Hong Kong;
            ``(2) to encourage them to take similar steps to ensure the 
        rights of nonviolent protesters are protected from 
        discrimination due to the actions of the Government of Hong 
        Kong and of China; and
            ``(3) to offer to share information, as appropriate, 
        regarding the execution of such policy, including information 
        regarding persons eligible for relief under such policy.''.

SEC. 6. PROTECTING UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND OTHERS FROM RENDITION TO 
              MAINLAND CHINA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The proposed amendments to Hong Kong's Fugitive 
        Ordinance, if enacted--
                    (A) would allow rendition from Hong Kong of 
                residents or foreign nationals to countries--
                            (i) with criminal procedure systems that 
                        lack strong protections for the rights of 
                        defendants; or
                            (ii) in which the law is used as to repress 
                        internationally recognized human rights, 
                        including to mainland China;
                    (B) would remove independent legislative oversight 
                and appropriate judicial review of extradition 
                requests;
                    (C) may increase the influence of the Government of 
                China in Hong Kong and further erode the autonomy 
                guaranteed Hong Kong by the Joint Declaration; and
                    (D) would erode Hong Kong's reputation as a center 
                of commerce and freedom governed by the rule of law.
            (2) The Government of China has subjected Chinese and 
        foreign nationals, including citizens of the United States, 
        Canada, Australia, Sweden, and Taiwan, to arbitrary detention, 
        televised confessions, denial of legal representation and 
        medical treatment, and other type of mistreatment.
    (b) Policy Statements.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to ensure that United States citizens are protected 
        from rendition to mainland China;
            (2) pursuant to section 103(7) of the United States-Hong 
        Kong Policy Act of 1992 (22 U.S.C. 5713(7)), to encourage 
        United States businesses ``to continue to operate in Hong Kong 
        in accordance with applicable United States and Hong Kong 
        law''; and
            (3) pursuant to section 201(b) of such Act (22 U.S.C. 
        5721(b)), to decide whether the Government of Hong Kong is 
        ``legally competent to carry out its obligations'' under 
        treaties and international agreements established between the 
        United States and Hong Kong.
    (c) Response to Threat of Rendition.--If the proposed amendments to 
Hong Kong's Fugitive Offenders Ordinance are enacted, and the amended 
law allows renditions to countries that lack protection for the rights 
of defendants--
            (1) not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment 
        of such amendments, the President shall submit a report to the 
        appropriate congressional committees that--
                    (A) assesses whether the Government of Hong Kong is 
                ``legally competent'' to administer the United States-
                Hong Kong Agreement for the Surrender of Fugitive 
                Offenders;
                    (B) determines whether any additional authorities 
                are needed to revise or withdraw from that treaty to 
                protect United States citizens and national security 
                and to support the guaranteed protections of the Joint 
                Declaration; and
                    (C) includes a strategy for protecting United 
                States citizens from rendition to mainland China from 
                Hong Kong, including an assessment of--
                            (i) whether additional resources are needed 
                        for American Citizen Services at the United 
                        States Consulate in Hong Kong; and
                            (ii) whether the Department of State will 
                        revise the travel advisory for Hong Kong to 
                        reflect the potential impact of the revised 
                        Fugitive Offenders Ordinance on United States
