SEC. 3. REVIEW AND REPORT ON TYPES OF INFORMATION TO BE LISTED.

    Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services shall--
            (1) solicit public comment regarding the type of 
        information, if any, that should be added to or removed from 
        the list required by paragraph (9) of section 351(k) of the 
        Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(k)), as added by 
        section 2; and
            (2) transmit to Congress an evaluation of such comments, 
        including any recommendations about the types of information 
        that should be added to or removed from the list.
